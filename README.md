#PolymerPlayer

A simple music player prototype built with Polymer inspired by [Meaningful Tranisition section in the Material Design Spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/meaningful-transitions.html#meaningful-transitions-meaningful-transitions-examples). Dominant colors were grabbed by using [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) for each album cover. (I think the Polymer team needs to incorporate something like Color Thief)

Note: songs won't actually play because I didn't upload them. To play songs, you'll need to add your own mp3s and update the songs.json file.
